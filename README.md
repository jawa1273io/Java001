# 🤖 Agentic AI Chatbot

Welcome to the **Agentic AI Chatbot** project! This repository hosts a smart, autonomous, and extendable chatbot that can make decisions, invoke tools, and act like an intelligent agent.

Whether you're exploring AI agents, building customer service bots, or prototyping a digital assistant, this project is your launchpad.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Agentic Behavior**: Not just reactive — the bot takes initiative, plans, and reasons.
- **Tool Usage**: Dynamically uses APIs, search engines, or custom functions during conversations.
- **Context Awareness**: Maintains short-term memory of conversations and task objectives.
- **Modular Design**: Easily extendable with custom tools, prompts, or memory modules.
- **LLM-agnostic**: Can plug into OpenAI, Claude, or local models via LangChain or custom APIs.
- **Role-based Personalities**: Configure multiple agents (e.g., teacher, assistant, coach) with different behaviors.

## ⚡ Usage

### 🔹 Run the Bot Locally (CLI)
```bash
python app.py
```
Then start chatting directly in the terminal or command line interface.

### 🔸 Use via Streamlit (GUI)
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This launches a friendly browser-based UI for chatting with your agent.

## 💡 Use Cases

- 🧑‍🏫 **AI Tutor**: A teaching agent that helps explain concepts step by step.
- 🧠 **Idea Generator**: An agent that brainstorms startup ideas or research directions.
- 🤖 **Dev Assistant**: Can generate boilerplate code, test cases, or explain bug fixes.
- 💬 **Customer Service Bot**: Integrate with website chat to provide 24/7 support.
- 🧘 **Mental Coach**: Reflective personality for journaling, self-coaching, and affirmations.

## 🧩 Extending the Bot

1. **Add a New Tool**: Drop a Python file in `tools/`, define a function, and register it in `chat_engine.py`
2. **Create a New Agent**: Add an agent configuration in `agents/` with a custom prompt/persona.
3. **Switch LLMs**: Modify `config.py` to use another language model API.
